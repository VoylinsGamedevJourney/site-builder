# Site Builder - Made with Godot

> The name is subject to change.

## What is Site Builder

This is a static site builder for blogs. It is my program which I want to use to manage my websites, [voylinslife.com](https://voylinslife.com) and my programming related website [voylin.com](https://voylin.com).

## Current status

Been working on this specific site-builder on and off but since 2024-03-01 I decided to remake it into a [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) application as it is probably going to be a lot easier in the long run and it was always my intention to create an user interface for this with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) anyway.

## Goal

To become a good functioning static site builder which even people without html/css/js knowledge can use.
